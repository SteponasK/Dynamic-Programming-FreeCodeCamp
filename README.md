# FreeCodeCamp Dynamic Programming 

## 🧑‍💻 What it Dynamic Programming
- Dynamic Programming is a method used in __mathematics__ and __computer science__ to __solve complex problems__ by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more __efficient solutions__ for a __wide range of problems__.

## ❓ Why learn it?
- Dynamic Programming mindset is very useful in solving __Olympiad of Informatics__ problems.
- I completed this course to prepare for __2023-24 Lithuanian Olympiad in Informatics__
